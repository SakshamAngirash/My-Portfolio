      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a second-year B.Tech CSE undergraduate at JUIT with expertise in C,
        C++, JavaScript, and Solidity. Proficient in data structures and
        algorithms, I am currently focused on blockchain technologies, building
        projects using Web3 and ReactJS. Excited by the potential of blockchain,
        I aim to create decentralized solutions and innovative applications.
        Continuously learning and staying up to date with emerging technologies
        is crucial to me. Combining my programming skills with blockchain, I
        aspire to develop impactful and scalable solutions at the intersection
        of web development and decentralized systems.
